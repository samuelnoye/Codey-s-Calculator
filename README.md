# Codey-s-Calculator
Codey's Calculator Codey’s made it to DevCity: a place full of Android applications, web development, and other endless implementations of the Kotlin language!  In this project, we’ll utilize our knowledge of Kotlin classes to help Codey build a basic calculator application that many of us have built-into our smartphones.  Our calculator will be able to:  Find the sum + Find the difference - Find the product ✕ Find the quotient ÷ Find the power ＾ A variation of this project exists in our Learn Java course so if you’re learning Kotlin with a Java background, we highly recommend comparing the syntaxes and code implementations once you’ve completed this project to better understand the similarities and differences between the two languages.
